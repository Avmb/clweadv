Antonio Valerio Miceli Barone

Requires:

Theano http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/
Lasagne https://lasagne.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
scikit-learn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
Word embeddings for two languages in word2vec https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/ text format

This package includes code to run various experiments with different variants of the approach presented in the paper. The best looking results were obtained with the adversarial autoencoder with Resnet discriminator, cosine distance reconstruction loss and cosine distance regularization:
